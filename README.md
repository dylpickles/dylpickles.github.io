My engineering portfolio

Hopefully this website will fully document my work in a legible fashion. 

Edits to make:
1. Write up short descriptions of my projects on the landing page. Maximize information obtainable without clicking
2. 


Fixes: 
 - Favicon needs a "?" at the end of the href link string to work properly ("public/tab picture.png?")
 - Different font for the projects
 - Maybe gallery view for the projects
